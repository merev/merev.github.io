*Electric current* refers to the amount of charge that flows through a cross-sectional area *A* over a given period of time. This cross-sectional area might represent a disk within a gas, plasma, or liquid. In electronics, however, it is typically a section cut through a solid material, such as a conductor.

If $\Delta Q$ is the amount of charge passing through an area in a time interval $\Delta t$, then the *average current* $I$<sub>ave</sub> is defined as:
